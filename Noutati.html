                <p>If adventure has a final and all-embracing motive, it is surely this: we go out because it is our nature to go out, to climb mountains, and to paddle rivers, to fly to the planets and plunge into the depths of the oceansâ€¦ When man ceases to do these things, he is no longer man</p>

            <p> We all know the health benefits of getting the right amount of Vitamin D. There is no better or more natural way to get your fill than by being out in the sunshine. Just 15 minutes a day is all you really need, but you go ahead and spend as long as you want soaking up the rays in the Sunshine State. Just don't forget your sunscreen!</p>
