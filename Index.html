            <p> A 16-year-old set sail from Portsmouth harbour on Saturday in a bid to become the youngest person to sail solo around the world. </p>

            <p>Michael Perham, who became the youngest person to cross the Atlantic alone when he was 14, left Portsmouth at 11:10 am aboard a 50-foot (15-metre) yacht, his spokesman Kizzi Nkwoch told AFP.</p>
        
            <p>He will cover 21,600 <span>nautical</span> miles, crossing every single line of longitude and the equator, in four and a half months, and his only contact with family members back home will be limited to brief satellite conversations.</p>
